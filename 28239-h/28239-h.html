<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Lying west of the Allegheny Mountains and extending
westward for some three hundred miles, bounded, for
the most part, on the north by the Ohio River and extending
to the Mississippi, lies the State of Kentucky.
In its eastern portion, constituting nearly one-third of
its area, the surface is broken, and so high as to be
termed mountainous. A large area occupying the central
third, and in the early day mostly a prairie land, is
now known as the famous Blue Grass section. The western
third of the State is practically level, being but a
few feet above the sea, and cypress swamps are not
infrequent. This section is commonly termed <span class="tei tei-q">“The
Pennyrile.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the middle of the eighteenth century, Kentucky was
a portion of that unexplored western realm belonging by
grant to the State of Virginia, and designated as a part
of Fincastle County. The eastern portion in the early
day abounded in wild game common to the Appalachian
forests. The undulating grass lands in the central part
of the State provided ample grazing for the herds of buffalo
and deer that were found there at the time of the
coming of man. The skeletons that have been exhumed
indicate that it was the feeding ground of the giant mastodon
before the discovery of America.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
About two hundred years after Columbus discovered
America, a young man twenty-two years of age came to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page4">[pg 4]</span><a name="Pg004" id="Pg004" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Canada from the Old World. On his arrival he learned
    from the settlers and Indians the <a name="corr004" id="corr004" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">possibility</span> of a passage
to the South Sea, which they then thought the Gulf of
Mexico to be. Desirous of making this journey, and
lured by the possibility of reaching the Pacific by water,
he secured the assistance of Indians and some white hunters
as guides and set out upon an expedition of exploration
into the country concerning which he had heard
such fascinating stories.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Crossing the St. Lawrence and traveling southward,
he came to what is now called Allegheny River. Securing
birchbark canoes, he and his party descended the
Allegheny to its junction with the Monongahela, then
turning southwestward on the beautiful stream formed
by these two small rivers and now known as the Ohio,
he explored the country along the banks of the river to
what was called by him the Rapids of the Ohio. Thus,
LaSalle was the first to gaze upon the country from the
mouth of the Big Sandy to the present site of Louisville,
and to make a record of such discoveries.

<h2 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 2.88em; margin-top: 2.88em"><span style="font-size: 144%">The Virginians and Daniel Boone</span></h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Near the middle of the eighteenth century, or about
1750, a party of Virginia hunters, growing weary of the
monotony of home life and desiring to find better hunting
grounds, penetrated the Appalachian Mountains by
way of Powell’s Valley and through Cumberland Gap,
into the eastern portion of what is now Kentucky, and
hence were the first white men to approach the land
from the eastern side. In 1767, John Finley and Daniel
Boone, hearing of the fine hunting in this section, came
to Kentucky from North Carolina and built a cabin on
Red River, near where Estill, Powell, and Clark counties
are now joined. Two years later, about forty hunters
and adventurers came to the territory and made their
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page5">[pg 5]</span><a name="Pg005" id="Pg005" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>camp at what they then called Price’s Meadows, about
six miles from the present site of Monticello in Wayne
County. This camp, by virtue of its location near the
Cumberland River, developed into a distributing point
for the country lying along the Cumberland, now included
in Wayne, Green, Barren and Warren counties.
Another station was built near Greensburg. These stations
or camps seem to have served only the immediate
needs of the hunters while they were in the territory.
</p>

  <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"></p><div class="tei tei-figure" style="width: 100%; text-align: center"><img src="images/ill_005.png" width="321" height="411" alt="Daniel Boone" title="Daniel Boone" /><div class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.90em; margin-top: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">Daniel Boone</span></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Daniel Boone seems to have been
the only one of these hunters to whom
the wilderness especially appealed.
Consequently, for many years he made
frequent trips into the territory, staying
as long as two years on one occasion,
and winning the title of The Long
Hunter. Boone was alone on many of
these trips, never seeing the face of a
white man, but frequently meeting
roving bands of Indians. From a cave in the side of Pilot
Knob in Powell County, he could catch glimpses of the
joyous sports of the Shawnee boys at Indian Fields; and
from the projecting rocks he feasted his eyes on the herds
of buffalo winding across the prairie.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
No permanent Indian villages were found in Kentucky.
It seems to have been a choice bit of hunting ground
strongly contested by the tribes of the North and the
tribes of the South. The Shawnees had a village at Indian
Fields, in the eastern portion of Clark County, near
the beautiful stream called Lulbegrud Creek.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Boone seems to have been endowed with the faculty
that enabled him to pass, in his first years of wandering,
from tribe to tribe; and from these Indians he learned
that the common name of the country, known to all, was
Kan-tuckee (kane-tooch-ee), so called by the Indians
be<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page6">[pg 6]</span><a name="Pg006" id="Pg006" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>cause of the abundance of a peculiar reed growing along
the river, now known as pipe-stem cane.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Boone remained in the wilderness so long that his
brother and a searching party came to find him. They
found him in good health and spirits, enjoying life, and
living in peace with the Indian tribes. The party, with
Boone, returned to the valley of the Yadkin, and told
such stories of the enchanted land as caused the settlers
of the region to listen eagerly, and to feel the stirring of
the pioneer spirit. Not caring for the growing crops and
with no relish for the monotonous labor, Boone easily
persuaded a company of men to come with him to the
wilderness and to bring their families.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The journey was tedious. Those on foot went ahead
and blazed a trail for the few wagons, pack horses and
domestic animals, and killed game to furnish meat when
the next camp should be struck at nightfall. It was a
courageous, jolly party that thus marched through Cumberland
Gap, and blazed a way which has since been
known as Boone’s Trail. Hostile Indians had to be
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page7">[pg 7]</span><a name="Pg007" id="Pg007" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>fought along the way, and several of the party were
slain, among them being Boone’s son. An Englishman,
also, was killed, and his young son was adopted by Boone
and thereafter known as his own son.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The party passed the present site of Richmond in Madison
County, and reached a point on the Kentucky River, in
1775, where Boonesborough was built. The site selected
was a broad, level stretch of land, with the river to
the north, and high
hills to the south.
This particular
spot was selected
because of a fine
spring of water,
and high hills that
could be used for
sentinel towers,
inclosing fine level
ground for cultivation.
The settlers
cut trees and constructed
a stockade
in the form of a hollow square. It was from this fort that
Rebecca Boone and the Calloway girls were stolen by
Indians while boating on the Kentucky River.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
About the same time that Boonesborough was being
established, Captain James Harrod with a party of forty
men descended the Ohio River, stopped for a time at the
mouth of Licking River, and felled some trees on the
present site of Cincinnati. Not being satisfied with the
location of the settlement, they followed the Ohio to the
mouth of the Kentucky River and ascended the Kentucky
to a spot now known as Oregon Landing. Being fatigued
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page8">[pg 8]</span><a name="Pg008" id="Pg008" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>from their long and difficult voyage, they left their boats
and took a course from the river and found a big spring
at which they built a stockade on the present site of Harrodsburg.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The large flowing spring one mile west of the present
town of Stanford, Lincoln County, was made the site of a
third settlement. Capt. Benjamin Logan headed this
party of pioneers, and the station was, for a time, known
as Logan’s Fort. Afterward, because of the fact that the
fort was made by planting logs on end, it was called
Standing Fort, and in later years the town was called
Stanford. In the Logan party was a priest who was a
musician of rare ability. In his daily walks, he was
accustomed to sit, meditating, at the mouth of the cave
from which ran the water of this great spring. The ripple
of the stream flowing from the cavern, over the rocks
and through the spearmint, was music to the Father’s
ear, and to him it seemed the spirit of St. Asaph, the
director of King David’s choir. He it was who named
the spring and the creek which flows from it, St. Asaph’s.

While the people busied themselves at Harrodsburg,
Boonesborough and Logan’s Fort, Simon Kenton, disappointed
in a love affair in Virginia, seeking relief from
sorrow by satisfying his hunger for hunting and at the
same time acting in the interest of Lord Dunmore, came
to Kentucky. He reached a point near Old Washington
in Mason County, where he and his party cleared an
acre of land, planted corn and ate the roasting ears the
same summer. So far as we know, this was the first
agricultural activity in the Commonwealth.

In April, 1775, the first battle of the Revolutionary War
was fought at Lexington, Mass. At that time a party of
hunters was camped at the big spring near the present
site of the Fayette County courthouse, in Lexington, Ky.
Months later, the news of the American victory reached
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page9">[pg 9]</span><a name="Pg009" id="Pg009" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the settlers, and because of their great joy over the victory
gained, they named the camp site Lexington.

In 1779, Lexington was first permanently improved and
cabins built. From these rude stockade cabins grew <a name="corr009" id="corr009" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">the</span>
beautiful city of the Blue Grass, in which town for
many years were manufactured practically all the fur hats
worn in the Ohio and
Mississippi valleys.
Being in the center of
the hemp-growing section,
practically all the
ropes and cables used
in boating on the Ohio,
Mississippi and Kentucky
rivers were made
in Lexington. These
commercial enterprises,
together with the exceptional
fertility of the
soil, account for the development of the city of Lexington
more rapidly than the surrounding forts and stations.

Daniel Boone was consulted regarding the advisability
of the location of all settlements made during the early
days, because he knew the country better than any other
one person, and knew the wilderness as few have
known it.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Hunters and trappers began to traffic along the Ohio
River, and supplies for the more northern settlements
were shipped on the Ohio and unloaded at Limestone or
at The Rapids. At this latter point it was necessary, if
supplies were sent farther down the stream, to unload
and carry them to a point below the rapids, when the
boats would have to be launched again and reloaded.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page10">[pg 10]</span><a name="Pg010" id="Pg010" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>This necessitated a delay, especially as the traders soon
fell upon the plan of having one line of boats plying
above the rapids and another plying between points below
the rapids. Men for unloading and loading were kept
always on the ground. This little settlement became permanent,
and is now the largest town in the State—Louisville.

After the wives of the settlers in the various forts
came to Kentucky, home life took on the appearance of a
settled community. Homes were built outside the stockades,
nearly every man of family had a farm of his own,
land was cleared, fruit trees were set out, attention was
given to the raising of hogs, sheep, cattle and horses, and a
little Empire of
the West began
to appear. The
women were
busy with spinning,
weaving
and general
housework.
The men cleared
and fenced
their land. The
fortifications
were kept only
as a refuge in time of an attack by the Indians—which,
however, was not infrequent, because the French in the
North coveted the rich lands beyond the Alleghenies, and
incited the Indians to warfare against the white people
who were settling there. It was the sturdy pioneers of
Kentucky, acting in the name of Virginia, who held the
frontier against the encroachments of the French, as the
property of the English crown.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The notorious renegade, Simon Girty, a white man
who for certain reasons forsook civilized society and associated
himself with the Indians of Northern Ohio, was
willing at all times to harass the settlers on the frontier
at the suggestion of the French military commanders.
This man cared not for spilling the blood of his own race,
and frequently would lead his hostile bands in attacks
against the unprotected settlements. His favorite time
for attack seemed to be in the spring of the year, when
the men were at work in the fields and offered the least
resistance by a speedy rally of forces.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We have noticed that all these forts were built near a
spring of unfailing water. The pioneers seem always to
have left the spring outside the inclosure, however, and
since this worked a great hardship in time of siege, it
seems to have been bad judgment. Girty’s Indians attacked
Logan’s Fort. The supply of water inside the
fort was exhausted, and the suffering was intense. After
this siege, General Logan decided never again to be subjected
to such an extremity. He could not bring the
spring to the fort, and it was also difficult to transplant
the fort. So he summoned the settlers and proposed a
plan to which they agreed. The hours when they were
not working in the fields or building new cabins they spent
in digging, until a tunnel was made from the stockade to
the spring. In succeeding attacks, the General had his
granaries and storehouses well supplied with food and
ammunition, and it was an easy matter to send a boy with
a bucket through the tunnel to the spring for water. This
precaution on the part of the General prevented exhaustion
during the next attack on Logan’s Fort. The Indians,
unable to understand how the settlers in the fort could
do so long without water, supposed them to be miraculously
defended by the Great Spirit, and never afterward
could Girty lead his band to attack Logan’s Fort.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page12">[pg 12]</span><a name="Pg012" id="Pg012" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The settlers at Bryan’s Station, a few miles from Lexington,
did not take a similar precaution. During one
of the Indian attacks on them the supply of water in
the fort became exhausted, and surrender seemed unavoidable.
The women of the fort volunteered to go for
water, and taking buckets marched down to the spring.
The Indians were surprised, superstitious, and panic-stricken,
and refused to fire on them. The women filled
their buckets and returned in safety to the stockade.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Notwithstanding the bounteous provision made by
Nature to supply the needs of the settler in the way of
fruits, wild meats, and skins for clothing, life in the
settlements was plain in the extreme. Furniture and
household utensils were scant and crude, for the most
part being of home construction. Salt was one of the
greatest needs of the settlers. At first, they made it from
the water of the numerous salt licks, each family making
its supply by boiling the water in a kettle until the moisture
had evaporated, leaving the salt encrusted in the
kettle. These kettles were crude, and invariably small.
Hence it was more difficult to supply a family with salt
than with sugar, which was easily made by boiling down
the sap from the maple trees. After awhile, the Virginia
authorities sent out a number of large kettles and two
expert salt makers, who reported to Captain Boone for
service. Boone, with his two experts and thirty other
men, left Boonesborough for the Lower Blue Lick Spring,
fifty or more miles toward the north. Here they made a
camp and set to work to manufacture a stock of salt sufficient
to supply the needs of all the settlements for a
period of twelve months. From time to time a small
party was sent back to the different forts with packhorses
laden with salt. On their return, they would
bring supplies, parched corn, and perhaps a few of the
simple comforts that seemed almost luxuries to the hardy
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page13">[pg 13]</span><a name="Pg013" id="Pg013" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>backwoodsmen. Meat constituted the chief article of
diet for the workers of the salt factory. It required no
small amount to satisfy the appetites of thirty vigorous
men. Boone, as the most expert hunter among them,
undertook to supply the camp with meat. The task was,
to him, a thoroughly congenial one, which we cannot
imagine the more civilized task of manufacturing salt to
have been.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was Boone’s custom to go out some miles from camp
every morning, returning at the close of the day with as
much game as he could carry, and often leaving a quantity
at a particular spot to be sent for with a packhorse.
One afternoon Boone was making his way toward the
salt works after a day of successful hunting, when he
suddenly found himself surrounded by a company of Indians.
Not having seen a redskin for months, and believing
it unlikely that they could be present in large
numbers at that time of the year, Boone was not as
keenly on the alert as usual. The savages had found
Boone’s trail while wandering through the woods. He
was taken captive, adopted into the tribe, his hair picked
out in Indian fashion, and the war paint added. Boone’s
failure to return led the men in the camp to suspect the
presence of Indians, and to guess that Boone had fallen
captive. The alarm was quickly sent to the surrounding
forts. Maj. Harlan, Col. Trigg, Col. Todd, and Boone’s
brother led a body of men against the Indians in what
proved to be the bloodiest battle recorded in the annals
of the territory, and known as the Battle of Blue Licks.
In this battle, Boone’s eldest son was slain, and it is said
the old man never could refer to the battle without shedding
tears. In the midst of the battle, Boone escaped
from his captors and rejoined the settlers.

Among the many men of sterling quality who for various
reasons came out to Kentucky, was one stalwart,
well-trained, military genius known in history as General
George Rogers Clark. His first trip to Kentucky was
semi-official, as a representative of the Virginia Legislature,
to visit the various forts and settlements and to
report progress to the state government. He found the
settlers in dire need of powder. Reporting this to the
Virginia authorities, he succeeded in
securing for the settlers a quantity,
which was yet insufficient to defend
them against the Indians.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Of Clark’s second appearance in
Kentucky, General Ray, who was at
that time a boy of sixteen, living at
Harrodsburg (or Harrod’s Station as it
was then called), gives the following
account: <span class="tei tei-q">“I had come down to where
I now live, about four miles from Harrodsburg,
to turn some horses on the range. I had killed a
small blue-winged duck that was feeding in my spring, and
had roasted it nicely by a fire on the brow of the hill. While
waiting for the duck to cool, I was startled by the sudden
    <a name="corr014" id="corr014" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">appearance</span> of a fine, soldierly-looking man. <span class="tei tei-q">‘How
do you do, my little fellow? What is your name? Aren’t
you afraid of being in the woods by yourself?’</span> Answering
his inquiries, I invited him to partake of my duck,
which he did, without leaving me a bone to pick, his
appetite was so keen. Had I known him then as I did
afterwards, he would have been welcome to all the game
I could have killed. Having devoured my duck, he
asked me questions about the settlers, the Indians and
the condition of affairs in the locality.”</span> These the boy
answered as well as he could, and then ventured to ask
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page15">[pg 15]</span><a name="Pg015" id="Pg015" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the name of his guest. <span class="tei tei-q">“My name is Clark,”</span> was the
response, <span class="tei tei-q">“and I have come out here to see how you
brave fellows are doing in Kentucky, and to lend you a
helping hand, if necessary.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With the universal consent of the settlers, Clark naturally
assumed the military leadership of the territory,
visiting all the fortifications, looking after their military
stores, drilling the men, and otherwise strengthening
the defenses of the pioneers. Clark made other trips to
Virginia in behalf of the frontiersmen, but since the resources
of Virginia were severely taxed by the necessary
support given to the other colonies during the Revolutionary
War, he received little or no encouragement, and
practically nothing in the way of military supplies. It
is stated that he provided the necessities at his own expense,
defraying the cost of transportation and distribution.
Later, powder was made by the settlers of Kentucky
by leaching saltpetre from the soil in various
sections and combining it with charcoal and other ingredients.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The English army officers formed alliances with the Indian
tribes living north of the Ohio River in the territory
now composing Ohio, Indiana and Illinois and incited
them to frequent attacks on the Kentucky settlements,
with the hope that they would the sooner capture the
State of Virginia by an approach from the west. Clark,
as military commander of Kentucky, sent spies into this
northern country to determine the location of the fortresses
and the number of English and Indians in each.
One of these spies was the celebrated Simon Kenton,
who was not content with locating the enemy but attempted
to recapture a lot of horses stolen from Kentucky
by the Indians on a former raid. Kenton and his
companions were not able to travel fast with the number
of horses they had secured, and when they were
at<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page16">[pg 16]</span><a name="Pg016" id="Pg016" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>tacked by a band of Indians, Kenton’s companions were
slain and he was captured. The Indians hated him cordially
and began to beat him unmercifully, calling him
the <span class="tei tei-q">“hoss-steal.”</span> They easily could have murdered
Kenton on the spot, but since he had proved such a terrible
foe to them in the past, they preferred to enjoy
their capture all the more by torturing him for awhile.
He was carried by the Indians to Chillicothe, where he
was several times forced to run the gauntlet. Finally,
when tied to the stake to be burned, he was recognized
by his boyhood friend, Simon Girty, who sent him to
Detroit, from which place he made his escape and returned
to Kentucky, reporting to General Clark the conditions
as he had found them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Other spies returned, and from the general reports
General Clark thought it necessary to make another appeal
to Virginia for aid. In 1778, Governor Patrick
Henry of Virginia gave to Clark a commission as commanding
officer to take such soldiers as he could secure
in Virginia, together with his Kentuckians, and go
against the British and Indians north of the Ohio River.
Leaving Corn Island, now Louisville, he and his brave
followers marched northward through swamps and swam
streams, capturing every fortification to which they
came. Among these were Kaskaskia and Vincennes.
By this heroic deed of Clark’s the great territory north
of the Ohio River was secured from the British, and became
a part of Virginia’s territory. Clark continued at
the head of military affairs in Kentucky, but his greatest
work was done before he was thirty years of age.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When peace came, Clark settled about eight miles from
Louisville and fell into habits of intemperance which
unfitted him for public service. He was given large
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page17">[pg 17]</span><a name="Pg017" id="Pg017" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>land bounties by Virginia, in recognition of services
rendered, but conflicting claims prevented him coming
into possession of the land for years, thus leaving him
helpless and poor in his old age. The Virginia legislature
voted him a jeweled sword, which was sent to the
old man by a special messenger. When the young man
made his speech presenting the sword, Clark replied,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Young man, go tell Virginia, when she needed a sword
I found one. Now, I need bread.”</span> The worn-out old
soldier lived only a little while longer, and in 1818 died
and was buried at Locust Grove, Ky. It has been said
that a French officer who met Clark at Yorktown, on his
return to France, said to the king: <span class="tei tei-q">“Sire, there are two
Washingtons in America.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“What do you mean?”</span> said
the king. <span class="tei tei-q">“I mean,”</span> said the officer, <span class="tei tei-q">“that there is
Washington whom the world knows; and there is George
Rogers Clark, the conqueror of the Northwest, as great
a man as Washington in his field of action and for his
opportunity.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Simon Kenton shared a like fate. Losing his land,
acre by acre, this simple-hearted old pioneer found himself
penniless in his old age. He was then allowed by
law, to the shame of all civilization, to be cast into prison
for debt upon the same spot upon which he had built his
first cabin in 1775. In 1799, as a beggar, he moved into
Ohio. In 1813, he joined Governor Shelby’s troops and
was with them in the Battle of the Thames. In 1820,
this poor old man moved to a site on Scioto river, where
the Indians forty years before had tied him to a stake to
be burned. Near the close of his life he was given some
mountain lands and a small pension.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Daniel Boone lost all his fine lands in Kentucky, also,
and came to such poverty as to lead him in one of his
petitions to say, <span class="tei tei-q">“I have not a spot of ground whereon
to lay my bones.”</span> He left Kentucky, saying he would
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page18">[pg 18]</span><a name="Pg018" id="Pg018" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>never return to live in a country so ungrateful. About
1796 he moved to Missouri and settled fifty miles from
St. Louis. Spain owned that territory then, and the
Spanish government gave him a liberal grant of land.
Around him his sons and daughters and their families
settled. The broad forests were full of game, and here
Boone again indulged his passion for a hunter’s life.
The old hunter neglected to complete his titles to his new
lands, and these he also lost. Congress afterward made
him a smaller grant. He died in Missouri in 1820, at the
age of eighty-six, and was buried in a coffin which he
had made for himself some years before. In 1845, the
Legislature of Kentucky had the remains of the pioneer
and his wife removed and buried with honor in the
cemetery at Frankfort. A suitable monument was erected
to mark their resting place.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the early days of the settlement of Kentucky, all
men were not engaged in fighting Indians, building forts
and clearing ground. On the contrary, the fertility of
the soil and the wealth of timber and mineral led men to
look to the commercial value of real estate, and consequently
there was formed a powerful company known as
The Transylvania Land Company, which had for its purpose
the ownership and control of the valuable lands.
Judge Richard Henderson, a native of Virginia, was the
leader in the formation of this Company.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Taking advantage of the unsettled boundaries west of
the mountains and knowing that the several states
claimed the country by right of grants from the kings of
the countries of Europe, the Transylvania Company attempted
to organize the territory into a separate government.
These men gave the settlers no little worry over
the ownership of their lands, and because Virginia was
engaged in the War of the Revolution little attention was
paid to affairs in Kentucky. Finally, in 1776, the settlers
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page19">[pg 19]</span><a name="Pg019" id="Pg019" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>in Kentucky called a meeting at Harrodsburg and sent
Gabriel Jones and George Rogers Clark to the Legislature
of Virginia with a statement that unless Virginia
should protect the settlers against the Transylvania Company
and others, the people would organize the territory
into a separate government, and take their place among
the States. To this statement the Virginia Legislature
gave heed, and cut off from Fincastle County, Virginia,
all that unsurveyed territory west of the Allegheny
Mountains, and organized it into the County of Kentucky,
as a part of Virginia. This act enabled the settlers
to have a regular form of county government with
a sheriff and other county officials, as well as two representatives
in the Virginia Assembly.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Things went well in the new county for awhile. Agriculture
was engaged in more extensively and the good
work of developing the country went steadily on, interrupted
all too frequently by the attacks of the Indians
from the north, in very much the same manner as before,
though less frequently.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
People in the eastern colonies heard of the fertility of
the soil and of the many attractive features of the country,
and as a result large numbers from all the older
settlements determined to try their fortunes in the
favored land. Population increased to such an extent that
it was thought advisable to divide the territory into three
counties (Jefferson, Lincoln and Fayette), and courts were
established.

The treaty of peace which ended the War of the Revolution
was concluded in November, 1782, but the people
of Kentucky did not get the news for nearly four months
later. All were rejoiced that the struggle was ended and
confidently expected that trouble with the Indians would
cease, since there seemed no further reason for inciting
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page20">[pg 20]</span><a name="Pg020" id="Pg020" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>them to make war on the Kentuckians. The people were
doomed to disappointment. The treaty left possessions
so poorly defined that not only did the Indians make occasional
invasions into the territory to plunder, under
the direction of the military commanders of the north,
but the people were threatened by a still graver danger.
The unsettled boundaries and titles of lands along the
Mississippi River caused a question of ownership to arise
between France, England and Spain. Spain at that time
controlled the lower Mississippi River, and men from
that country secretly came to Kentucky attempting to
arouse the people to the act of establishing a separate
nation under the protection of Spain. The loyalty of the
good men of Kentucky to the rights of Virginia cannot
be too highly praised. There were some persons, though,
who for glory and private gain did all in their power to
stir up the rebellion and to establish a separate government.
Kentucky was virtually left to her fate beyond
the mountains during the trying times following the close
of the Revolution.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The needs of the territory and the constant menace
from these Spanish agents led the better class of men in
Kentucky to consider the question of asking Virginia to
be allowed the privilege of separation, with the expectation
of the territory’s being formed into a State, equal
with others of the Union. This would give a better administration
of affairs and would put an end to the efforts
of agents from other countries desiring to establish
a separate nation.

In 1786, Virginia passed the act providing for the
separation of Kentucky, but she made it conditional on
the willingness of the Congress of the United States to
admit Kentucky as one of the States of the Union, and
upon the willingness of Kentucky to become a member
of the Union as soon as separated from Virginia, thus
preventing Kentucky from becoming an independent republic,
or a part of any foreign nation. It was during
these days that enemies to both Kentucky and the nation
were busiest in their efforts secretly to plan for either
an independent government or an alliance with Spain.
Kentucky became a State in 1792, being the fifteenth in
the Union.

While the preceding pages have dealt largely with the
struggle for existence in the frontier country, it must
not be understood that during these years the entire attention
of the settlers was given to waging war against
the Indians. The Indian invasions were altogether too
frequent, and their savage cruelty entirely too terrible to
be mentioned here, and this continued for many years
after the country was supposed to be entirely free from
terrors of the sort. Yet the people had all the while
been doing remarkably well, not only in their efforts to
conquer the wilderness, but to establish a civilization
which compared favorably with the progress made in
the more settled sections of our country at that time.

The question of land titles offered a fine field for litigation,
and among the brilliant lawyers attracted to the
country was Henry Clay of Virginia, who in his twenty-fifth
year was elected to the State Legislature of
Ken<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page22">[pg 22]</span><a name="Pg022" id="Pg022" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>tucky, and at thirty was a United States Senator. From
this period, with but few brief intervals, his long life

In 1787, there was established at Lexington The Kentucky
Gazette, by John Bradford. This was the first
newspaper to be published west of the Allegheny Mountains.
Since they had no rural delivery in those days
the paper was sometimes weeks old before the people
received it. It was practically the only medium for the
general dissemination of knowledge throughout the settlements.
With great eagerness would the people of any
particular section assemble at their fort, store or tavern,
on <span class="tei tei-q">“paper day,”</span> and the brightest youngster or the most
accomplished reader in the community would delight his
auditors by reading aloud the things that had happened
in the world at large, the colonies in general, and in
Kentucky in particular.

At this early date, schools were established in Kentucky
and taught in the stockade forts. A Mrs. Coons
<span class="tei tei-q">“kept”</span> school at Harrod’s Station; John May at McAfee,
and a Mr. Doniphan at Boonesborough. Later, log cabin
school houses were built farther out into the settlements.
The school boys were required to carry guns with them
to school, that they might be ready to meet any danger.
School books were rare and very expensive. The diligent
teacher would copy from his rare and expensive
texts lessons to be learned in the subject of arithmetic
and other branches, often one copy serving a whole
family. In 1798, local school books appeared. The Kentucky
Primer and The Kentucky Speller were printed at
Washington, the old county seat of Mason county, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page23">[pg 23]</span><a name="Pg023" id="Pg023" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Harrison’s Grammar was printed at Frankfort in the
same year.

Twenty thousand acres of land were given by Virginia
for the establishment of Transylvania Seminary in 1783.
Its first principal was the Rev. David Rice, a pioneer
Presbyterian preacher and a graduate of Princeton University.
In 1787 the institution was moved from near
Danville to Lexington. George Washington contributed
liberally to the maintenance of this school, and Lafayette,
on his return to America, visited the school and made a
donation to its support. From this seminary grew the
now famous Transylvania University, Lexington, Ky.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In 1798 the Legislature of Kentucky donated six thousand
acres of land to each county then in existence, for
the purpose of establishing county seminaries. In many
sections of the state these old pioneer buildings of brick
and stone may be seen today. These institutions did
much for education in their time.

Our Commonwealth had, even at this early period,
produced an unusual number of inventors of note. John
Fitch, in 1786, first successfully applied steam as a motor
power to passenger boats. James Rumsey, the same
year, propelled a boat with steam. Edward West, in
1794, constructed a model boat and propelled it by steam,
on Elkhorn Creek, near Lexington. He later invented
the nail-cutting machine which made it possible to cut
nails rapidly from wrought iron, whereas they had formerly
been hammered out by hand. Thomas H. Barlow
invented the Planetarium, an instrument by which the
movements of the earth and moon around the sun were
shown.

was a great leader of men. He took an active interest in
political, civil, military and social affairs in Kentucky,
and was elected the first Governor of the State. On the
fourth of June, 1792, the Legislature

have been the selection of a site for a
permanent seat of government, or capital.
Frankfort was finally decided upon,

Intrigue on the part of foreign governments,
however, did not cease with
the organization of State government. The Spanish
governor at New Orleans continued to send emissaries
into the State, seeking to arouse a spirit of discontent,
and if possible bring about a separation of the State
from the Union. So successful were these agents that
they were able to secure the good will of some men
in high places, by paying as high as two thousand dollars
a year salary. One Thomas Power seems to have
been the most active agent of the Spanish government,
and he held out as an inducement the great commercial
privileges that would come to Kentucky through the free
navigation of the Mississippi River, and he further offered
to place two hundred thousand dollars at the disposal
of his friends if they would bring about a separation
from the nation. These treasonable offers, however,
were spurned, with one or two exceptions, by the sturdy
and loyal manhood of Kentucky.

After the overtures of the Spanish agents, came the
royal offers of an English protectorate, and later the

In 1805, Aaron Burr, whose term as Vice-President of
the United States had expired, became unpopular because
of his criticisms of the administration of President
Jefferson, and because of his having killed Alexander
Hamilton in a duel. Being ambitious, Burr was morbidly
restless because of the turn his fortunes had taken.
He visited Kentucky and different points between New
Orleans and St. Louis. He succeeded in drawing into
his plans one Blennerhassett, a wealthy man who lived
on a beautiful island in the Ohio River. It is supposed
that his plan was to found an empire in the West, and to
make himself the ruler of the same. During Burr’s
visits to Kentucky, it is said that he frequently made his
headquarters at an old brick residence in Eddyville,
overlooking the Cumberland River. In November, 1806,
Burr was brought into court at Frankfort, charged with
organizing a military expedition against Mexico. He was
defended by Henry Clay and the grand jury failed to indict
him. This acquittal was celebrated by a ball at Frankfort.
A few months later he was arrested in Alabama, taken to
Richmond, Va., and acquitted of treason after a trial lasting
six months.

The great Shawnee chief, Tecumseh, formed a federation
of all the northern tribes of Indians for a general
massacre of all settlers west of the Alleghenies. Kentucky
contributed a great number of soldiers to the army
under General William Henry Harrison. This army,
with Governor Shelby at the head of the Kentucky brigade,
marched against the northern tribes and defeated
them at the Battle of Tippecanoe. The fleeing Indians
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page26">[pg 26]</span><a name="Pg026" id="Pg026" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>were overtaken at the River Thames, and the cry of the
Kentuckians was, <span class="tei tei-q">“Remember the Raisin and revenge.”</span>
In this battle, Col. Richard F. Johnson of Kentucky slew
the noted chief, Tecumseh.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the second war between the United States and England,
in 1812, Kentuckians took a prominent part in
nearly all battles against the British. Especially did they
distinguish themselves as expert riflemen at the Battle of
New Orleans. Most of the cannon ball used in this battle
had been made at the old iron furnace in Bath County,
near where Owingsville now stands, and a great portion
of the powder had been manufactured from the saltpeter
leached from the soil in Mammoth Cave, Edmonson
County, Kentucky.

While Kentuckians were winning laurels on the battlefields
of the Indian wars and the War of 1812, literary
pursuits were not neglected. In 1785, John Filson wrote
the first history of the State, and drew maps of the region.
In 1812, Humphrey Marshall, Sr., also wrote a
history of Kentucky. Colleges were being established,
and young men were being trained in classical lore and
oratory. Among the prominent orators of the early day
were Thomas F. Marshall and Richard M. Menefee. The
genius, ready wit, satire, and forensic power of Marshall
made him a favorite with all audiences at all times; but
unfortunately his habit of intemperance lessened his
powers and closed his career. The oratory of Menefee
was so pleasing and convincing as to cause him to be
called the Patrick Henry of the West.

The wealth of timber, mineral, and farm products of
the State was so great as to cause early improvements in
the building of macadamized roads or pikes, and as early
as 1830 the turnpike from Maysville to Lexington was
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page27">[pg 27]</span><a name="Pg027" id="Pg027" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>built to facilitate the movement of freight and farm products
from the bluegrass region to the towns along the
Ohio River on the northern boundary. A similar road
was built from Louisville through Glasgow and Bowling
Green to Nashville, Tenn., and this road not only served
as a commercial outlet to the South, but has played an
important part in the history and subsequent development
of the State.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Early in the past century, interest was shown in the
making of the water courses of Kentucky navigable
throughout the year by the building of locks and dams.
These were built on Kentucky, Barren and Green Rivers.
Kentucky is said to have a greater number of miles of
navigable streams than is owned by any other State. Its
territory was supposed, in the early days, to extend to
low water mark on the eastern side of the Big Sandy
River, to the northern bank of the Ohio River, and to the
western bank of the Mississippi on the western border,
while the Kentucky, Barren and Green rivers lie wholly
within its borders, and the Cumberland and Tennessee
rivers cross the State in the western section. Green River
is said to be one of the deepest river waterways in the
world, and the scenery along its banks is indeed picturesque.
The towering walls on either side of the Kentucky
River between Frankfort and Beattyville rival in
grandeur and majestic beauty the famous palisades of
the Hudson or the castellated southern shore of the beautiful
Columbia River.

Railroad construction was early commenced in Kentucky.
While traveling from Lexington to Frankfort today
over the L. &amp; N. railroad, one can see from the car
windows the old grade and the cuts indicating the line
along which ran the early cars on stones in which
grooves were cut for the guidance of the wheels instead
of the steel rail and the flange wheel of the present day.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page28">[pg 28]</span><a name="Pg028" id="Pg028" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>These early cars were drawn by mules, after they had
been pulled by a windlass up the cliff from the boat landing

replaced by two locomotives and iron rails. One engine
brought the train from Frankfort to a point half way, by
noon, and after the passengers had eaten dinner at Midway,
the other engine took the train on to Lexington.

The early settlers from Virginia brought their slaves
with them, and when the State was established, no one
thought of abolishing the institution of slavery. The
melodious voices of the blacks could be heard in the
clearing grounds and the <span class="tei tei-q">“black mammies”</span> and the little
pickaninnies were familiar objects about every well-to-do
home. For the most part, the Kentuckian was considerate
of the welfare of his slaves, and both master and
slave were happy in the olden day. Those who are old
enough to remember, can tell some stories of the loyalty
of the slave to his master, and of the kindly relationship
that existed between the two races. About 1829 there
began to develop in the minds of many Kentuckians a
sentiment which afterward grew into strong opposition
to the state of affairs which made it possible for one
man to own the body and control the actions of another.
In 1831, Cassius M. Clay, while attending Yale College,
became thoroughly aroused to the evils of slavery, and
when he returned to Kentucky he began to speak and to
write in opposition to the institution. He established
a paper in Lexington by means of which he was able to
arouse sentiment in support of his contention against
slavery. He was probably the first pronounced and
powerful abolitionist in the State, and became almost as
famous in the South as was William Lloyd Garrison in
the North.

The question continued to be one of absorbing interest,
and the anti-slavery party gained in strength steadily.
When Texas declared her independence from Mexico, and
sought admission into the Union of States, the slavery
question was discussed in that connection in Kentucky as
heatedly as in any other section. General Zachary Taylor,
a native Kentuckian, born and reared near Louisville,
was placed in command of the American forces when war
was about to be declared against Mexico. This and the
fact that William O. Butler and Thomas Marshall were
commissioned officers under Taylor, and also from Kentucky,
served to increase the interest in the approaching
struggle with Mexico, and intensified the zeal of
both the slavery and the anti-slavery parties. Everywhere
the question was, <span class="tei tei-q">“Shall Texas come to us as a slave or
a free state?”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On the third of June, 1808, just about four years before
our Kentucky soldiers were called upon to enlist to do
battle against the British in the War of 1812, there was
born in an old-fashioned log house in that part of Kentucky
where the town of Fairview now stands, a boy
named Jefferson Davis, who was destined to become one
of the conspicuous characters in the nation. As a child,
he was mild of manner and rather timid, but possessed a
strong and resolute will. He willingly and easily learned
the contents of such books as the schools of the time
afforded, and at an early age he matriculated as a student
at Transylvania Seminary, where he distinguished himself
as a gentleman and a scholar. A point of interest in
Lexington is the quaint little house where he roomed
while he was a student at the Seminary.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The spirit of the times led young Davis to choose a
military career, and he entered West Point from which he
graduated in <a name="corr029" id="corr029" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">1828.</span> We find him soon as a captain in the
regiment commanded by General Zachary Taylor. While
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page30">[pg 30]</span><a name="Pg030" id="Pg030" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>stationed at Louisville, he met, wooed, and wed the
beautiful daughter of General Taylor—not, however,
with the consent and blessing of the General. A pretty
story is told of Davis and Taylor concerning their reconciliation.
During the Mexican War, Davis commanded
a company of artillery. On one occasion, General Taylor
ordered Captain Bragg to unlimber and fire at the enemy,
and Bragg was disposed to urge the futility of the effort,
since it would result in presenting the battery to the
Mexicans and he thought there was no
hope of holding the position. With the
coolness for which he was noted, Captain
Davis was seen to wheel his battery
into line, and he directed the maneuvres
in such manner as soon to be
in complete control, and the battle was
won. The next morning, says the story,
General Taylor sent an orderly to the
tent of Captain Davis, commanding him
to report at headquarters. The order was obeyed; and
when Davis had saluted his superior officer and stood
at attention, the crusty old general stepped forward and,
with a moistened eye, extended his hand and said,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Captain Davis, my daughter was a better judge of a man
than I.”</span> They were the warmest friends ever afterward.

While Davis was Secretary of War of the United States,
he practically reorganized the army and revised the tactics.
After the close of the Mexican War, he became a
Congressman from Mississippi, and afterward was sent to
the United States Senate from that State. When he
resigned his seat in the United States Senate, he delivered
a farewell speech setting forth his reasons for so
doing. This is said to be one of the greatest addresses
ever delivered before the Senate. He was chosen President
of the Southern Confederacy at a time when another

When the Civil War between the States of the Union
was about to begin, Kentucky refused to take sides in the
controversy, and in the strict sense of the term was
never out of the Union. When the President of the
United States called on Kentucky to furnish men and
equipment for the Union army, the Governor replied
that the State was neutral and would take no steps toward
secession, nor would it espouse coercion by force
of arms. The people, however, chose for themselves,
and enlisted in the Union or in the Confederate army, as
they believed to be in the right of the controversy. The
result was that about an equal number enlisted with both
armies. Hence the State became a common battleground
during the struggle, very much as it was in the
days when the Indian tribes from the North and from the
South met on our soil as a common battleground. Families
were divided as to their espousal of the respective
sides of the contest, father and son frequently taking up
arms on opposite sides. When the war closed, the people
went to work with a will to repair the damages incident
to the struggle, and no state has shown greater
progress in the development of its natural resources.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Probably no state has greater resources capable of development.

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page32">[pg 32]</span><a name="Pg032" id="Pg032" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>one-fourth the area of the whole state, and the western
coal fields underlie four thousand square miles, or about
one-tenth of the area of the state. Inexhaustible deposits
of iron ore are found, and the forests are exceedingly rich
in fine lumber.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The state has made wonderful progress in the development
